This repo contains a number of scripts for doing useful things with
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/), such as batch rendering or
obtaining information about dependencies of `.blend` files.

Each script has an explanation of its usage in its header.

The scripts are written in Python, most of them enclosed in a Bash
wrapper that launches Blender and feeds it the Python script for
execution within the application.
