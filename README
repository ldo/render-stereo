This repo contains a number of scripts for doing useful things with
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/), such as batch rendering or
obtaining information about dependencies of `.blend` files.

Each script has an explanation of its usage in its header.

The scripts are written in Python, enclosed in a Bash wrapper that
launches Blender and feeds it the Python script for execution within
the application.
