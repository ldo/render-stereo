estimate\-remaining \- estimate time remaining for rendering an animation in

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR estimate\-remaining " [" «options» "...] " «frames\-output\-dir» " " «final\-frame\-nr»

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B estimate\-remaining
is a command-line tool which, given a directory into which rendered frames
are being saved as individual image files and the expected number of the final
frame, will examine the timestamps on the most recent saved frames to estimate
when the render will finish.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-nr\-frames=«sample-size»
the number of most recent frames to examine the timestamps on. If omitted,
the default is 6.

.TP
.B \-\-estimate\-error|\-e
indcates that the output should include an estimate of the uncertainty
in the completion time.

.SH BUGS

Currently can only cope with frames saved as
.B .png
files. Needs to handle
at least
.B .exr
as well.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B estimate\-remaining frames/ 1600

Shows an estimate of how long it will take for frame number 1600 to appear
in directory
.B frames/
for a render currently in progress.

.B estimate\-remaining \-\-nr-frames=12 \-e frames/ 1600

Same as above, except base the estimate on the last 12 frames rendered, and
also include an estimate of the uncertainty in the completion time.
